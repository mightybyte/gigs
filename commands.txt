# This file outlines a list of commands that we should probably implement
# eventually.  They are grouped by general categories and roughly listed
# in the order that we should implement them.
# NOTE: There is a lot more involved than just these commands.  One example
# of this is ratings and ratings categories.  We could implement all of
# these commands without ever having ratings.  But that should obviously be
# done at some point in time.  I'm sure there are other similar issues
# that we will encounter later.
